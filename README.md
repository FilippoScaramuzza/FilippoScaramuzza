### Hi there üëã
Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some projects I worked on. They're mostly well documented, but if you have any comment or question just raise an issue or send me an e-mail. 
Below some info about me. 

<h2>üìö Studies</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently enrolled in the C<strong>omputer Science and Engineering</strong> <strong>Master's Degree</strong>, at the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. In 2021 I have got a Bachelor's Degree at the University of Parma in Computer, Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering. My Master's Degree specialization can be summarized as "<strong>Software Engineering for Complex Systems and Big Data</strong>".</p>

<h2>üñ•Ô∏è Technologies I enjoy</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've done some <strong>web programming</strong> work, using technologies like PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, NodeJs and React, jQuery, HTML and CSS. I like also developing full stack application using paradigms like the MERN/MEAN stack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, web programming is not my main interest. Indeed I have in the past years studied and deepened technologies related to <strong>B</strong><b>ig Data, </b>such as data science (<strong>Neural Networks and Machine Learning</strong>), <strong>NoSQL databases</strong> (Neo4j, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) and in general the good practices when developing software with such amount of data. My actual main interest, at the moment, is Distributed Computing and Parallel Programming. I've deepened some technologies like <strong>MPI </strong>and¬†<strong>Spark</strong> and in general I got familiar with <strong>Middlewares for Distributed Systems</strong>.</p>
During the years I've studied and appreciated a lot of programming languages, the following is a list of the ones I know at a decent level:
C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, PHP and Assembly

(It seems strange but I encountered Assembly a lot of times during the years, both at the High School and University, and I actually ended up appreciating it. The way you have to approach problems and thinking as a machine really tickles me).

If someone is interested in some of my works can checkout some of my projects on <a href="https://github.com/FilippoScaramuzza">GitHub/FilippoScaramuzza</a>.
