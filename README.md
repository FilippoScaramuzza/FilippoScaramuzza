### Hi there üëã
Welcome to my GitHub page. Here you can find some projects I worked on. They're mostly well documented, but if you have any comment or question just raise an issue or send me an e-mail. 
Below is some info about me. 

<h2>üìö Studies</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.jads.nl/">Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS)</a> in the Netherlands, working in the <a href="https://www.jads.nl/research-labs-safeguard/">Safeguard Lab</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en.html?icid=site_selector_global">Deloitte</a>.

I graduated from Politecnico di Milano with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in Spring 2024. I completed all my exams in the summer of 2023. I graduated shortly after completing an internship in R&D at Alten Labs in Sophia Antipolis, where I wrote my thesis titled "Universal Personal Privacy Agent: Toward Interoperability Between Self-Sovereign Identity and Personal Data Stores."

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer, Electronic, and Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Parma on October 21, 2021. During an internship at the university in the Distributed Systems Group, I wrote my Bachelor's thesis entitled "Simulation of N-Tier Fog Systems with Dynamic Service Placement."

<h2>üñ•Ô∏è Technologies I enjoy</h2>
I've been knee-deep in web programming, dabbling with PHP, JavaScript, WordPress, NodeJs, React, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I've even had some fun with full-stack development using the MERN/MEAN stack.

Another big part of my academic career is Big Data. I've been exploring data science with Neural Networks and Machine Learning, diving into NoSQL databases like Neo4j, MongoDB, Cassandra, and learning the best practices for software development in the face of massive amounts of data.

My fast-changing interests addressed also Distributed Computing and Parallel Programming. I've been delving into technologies like MPI and Spark, and getting to know Middlewares for Distributed Systems.

I've got to work with different programming languages over the years, from C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, to even Assembly.

If you're curious to check out some of my work, feel free to swing by my projects on GitHub.com/FilippoScaramuzza.

(It seems strange but I encountered Assembly a lot of times during the years, both at the High School and University, and I actually ended up appreciating it. The way you have to approach problems and thinking as a machine really tickles me).
